## 🏝️ **Overview**

**Windlight Island** is a third person atmospheric exploration and puzzle adventure set on a tranquil Mediterranean inspired island.  
Players embark on a peaceful journey through sunlit landscapes, forgotten ruins, and natural environments shaped by wind, water, and time. Without the presence of combat or enemies, the experience focuses entirely on **mindful discovery, environmental interaction, and calm exploration**.

Guided only by the elements, the player must collect **mystical lanterns** scattered across the island and activate an ancient shrine to restore balance to the land. Through scenic paths, wind-based physics puzzles, and gentle audio environments, **Windlight Island** invites players to slow down and reconnect with nature.

The game is built in **Unreal Engine 5.6**, utilizing **Nanite virtualized geometry**, **Lumen global illumination**, and a **dynamic wind simulation system**, creating highly detailed surfaces, natural lighting, and immersive ambience.
